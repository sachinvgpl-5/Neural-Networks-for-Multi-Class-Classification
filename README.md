# Neural-Networks-for-Multi-Class-Classification

This project shows the implementation of a single-layer Neural Network, a
multi-layer Neural Network and a Convolutional Neural Network, each used to
solve a multi-class classification problem. We train the models to learn from
Fashion MNIST dataset of clothing images and classify a given image into one
of 10 classes.
